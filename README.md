# Modal Window Interaction

This project was developed as part of "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" on Udemy, taught by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## About the Project

This project demonstrates the interactive functionality of opening and closing modal windows using both mouse clicks and the 'ESC' key. Modal windows are commonly used in web development for displaying additional information, forms, or interactive content without navigating away from the current page. Understanding how to implement modal window interactions is a fundamental skill for web developers, and this project provides a hands-on learning experience.
